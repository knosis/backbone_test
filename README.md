This is a mobile web application. It is a web app that will work on a mobile device. It is responsive and the perspective will remain consistent on various devices. I did not use Cordova for this assignment.

I created a todo list which saves to local storage. It was created using Backbone. The CSS was borrowed and modified from UIKit and Bootstrap.

The entire file including HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be found in the one HTML file.
